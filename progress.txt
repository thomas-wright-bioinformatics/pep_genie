Managed to authenticate to github.
It worked when I used gh to authenticate by ssh and a token. 
Then I initialised the repo
then pushed, then asked me to login. 
Seemed to work fine/ 
Next I need to set up PA to read website. 


set up the model, form and index page. 
Next, need to format the index page, 
then send info to model, 
then hook up the switchboard and grid.html pages
after, sort the javascript



Just added vis strip into pptx.
Also hooked up download page

Next:
Add fancy graph types template and hook it up into model
Add extra info in request page
Then upload to website!!
